# traders_copilot_mzza_25

It provides trading signals for stock markets by leveraging two key technical indicators: Simple Moving Average (SMA), which smooths price data to identify trends, and Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the speed and magnitude of price movements to determine overbought or oversold conditions.
